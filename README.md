# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

# Experiment :

Prompt : You are my personal productivity assistant. Your role is to help me manage, reorganize, and optimize my daily schedule whenever unexpected changes happen.
Here is my agenda for today ;

08:00–10:00 : PMC Class

10:00–12:00: PMC CIA

12:00–01:00 : Lunch

01:00–03:00: Cloud Computing Class

03:00–04:30: Prompt Engineering Class

ChatGPT said:

Now let’s walk through the next steps with your new agenda! Here’s how I would reorganize your day:

Updated Schedule : 

08:00–10:00 → PMC Class (as planned)

10:00–11:00 → Quick Review of PMC notes / Revise difficult topics (replaces cancelled CIA)

11:00–12:00 → Personal Study or Catch-up on Assignments (productive use of free time)

12:00–01:00 → Lunch (as planned)

01:00–03:00 → Cloud Computing Class (as planned)

03:00–03:30 → Rest Break (use freed slot from cancelled Prompt Engineering class)

03:30–04:30 → Self-learning: Work on Project / Explore AI Tools (extra opportunity)

Priorities:

🔴 High Priority → PMC Class, Cloud Computing Class

🟡 Flexible → Self-study, Assignment catch-up

🟢 Rest Opportunity → 03:00–03:30

Prompt: If I don't want to attend the cia on 10:00 - 12:00... rebuild this schedule to get maximum time gain for the day

ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 You’re skipping the 10:00–12:00 PMC CIA, so let’s reorganize your day to maximize productivity and balance:

✅ Revised Optimized Schedule

08:00–10:00 → PMC Class (essential, fixed)

10:00–11:00 → Self-Study: Revise PMC concepts / Prepare notes (productive replacement for CIA)

11:00–12:00 → Assignment Work or Project Progress (use the freed slot to get ahead)

12:00–01:00 → Lunch (as planned)

01:00–03:00 → Cloud Computing Class (essential, fixed)

03:00–03:30 → Rest Break (refresh mind after class)

03:30–04:30 → Deep Work Session (Prompt Engineering practice / Cloud Computing lab work) (fills the cancelled Prompt Engineering Class slot with independent study)

04:30–05:00 → Quick Review & Planning for Next Day (wrap-up with reflection and organization)

🔑 Why this works:

Converts cancelled class time (10–12) into focused self-study + assignments.

Keeps lunch and fixed classes unchanged for balance.

Inserts a rest break so you don’t burn out.

Uses the freed 03:00–04:30 slot for deep work or skill-building, giving you an edge.

Ends the day with review & planning, which maximizes long-term efficiency.

👉 This schedule gives you 2 full extra hours in the morning + 1 extra hour in the afternoon = 3 hours total gained for personal productivity.

Prompt : Now remove the most non mandatory task from this schedule and give me the updated schedule which should provide time to take rest

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 You want to remove the least mandatory task from the optimized schedule so you can get extra rest.

Looking at the last plan, the least mandatory task is:
👉 04:30–05:00 → Quick Review & Planning for Next Day (you can easily push this to tomorrow morning).

✅ Updated Rest-Focused Schedule

08:00–10:00 → PMC Class

10:00–11:00 → Self-Study: Revise PMC concepts

11:00–12:00 → Assignment Work or Project Progress

12:00–01:00 → Lunch

01:00–03:00 → Cloud Computing Class

03:00–03:30 → Rest Break 🟢

03:30–04:30 → Deep Work Session (Prompt Engineering practice / Cloud Computing lab work)

04:30–05:00 → Extra Rest or Free Time 🟢

🔑 Benefits:

Keeps core academic classes intact.

Retains morning productivity block (10–12).

Provides two rest periods:

Short recharge (03:00–03:30)

Longer downtime (04:30–05:00)

Avoids unnecessary over-scheduling → ensures balance.


# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
